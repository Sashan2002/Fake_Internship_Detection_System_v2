      <h1>About this system</h1>
      <p>
        This tool is an AI-based decision-support system for reviewing internship advertisements. It
        combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis of advertisement text with structured
        employer credibility indicators to produce a prediction, together with a confidence score,
        an uncertainty estimate, and an explanation of the factors that most influenced the result.

      <div className="panel">
        <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>What the result means</h2>
        <p>
          A result of <strong>Potentially Legitimate</strong> or <strong>Potentially Fraudulent</strong>
          {" "}describes the model's prediction for this specific submission — it is not proof of an
          organisation's legitimacy or fraud. A result of <strong>Requires Review</strong> means the
          model's confidence was too low to make either prediction reliably, and a human reviewer should
          look more closely.

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>Method, in brief</h2>
        <p>
          Advertisement text is analysed with a transformer-based language model (BERT/RoBERTa) or, for
          the current baseline configuration, a TF-IDF and logistic regression model. Employer and
          advertisement fields (contact details, salary disclosure, completeness of the listing, and
          similar) are converted into structured credibility indicators. Where the integrated model is
          active, both representations are combined before a final probability is produced.
        </p>

      <div className="panel">
        <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          The underlying research dataset (EMSCAD) is not specific to internships, includes a limited
          number of internship examples, and is class-imbalanced toward legitimate postings, which
          limits how confidently fraud can be detected, particularly for advertisement styles not well
          represented in the training data. Credibility indicators describe what is present or absent in
          a submission — they are not independent verification of an employer, and external
          verification (e.g. company registries) is not currently part of this system.
